## TEST, JEST, MOCHA

## What we need?

1. test runnre
2. prepration -> we need mock to assert -> use super-agent lib that super-test use it

**note**: to use mocha ( test runner ) we use chai ( assertion ) and istanbul ( code coverage )

3. for testing express app -> we use 'supertest' lib (read doc)
